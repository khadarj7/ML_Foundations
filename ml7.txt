What is deep learning - DL is type of ml that uses 
ann to learn complex pattern in data.

DL mimics the humain brain.


and why deep learning 

Handle complex data 

Improve the accuracy -> 

Automate feature learning -> dl model can automatically 
learn relevent feature from data

Artifical neural network

1. classification 
2. Regression


How ANN will work


SLP[Artificial neuron or Neural network unit] -> its refer to a single layer
neural network which means it has

1.input layer.
2.output layer.

it does not have any hidden layer.

MLP(multi layer perceptron )

1.input layer.
2. hidden layer(one or more hidden layer)
3. output layer.

Backpropagation  is an algo to train neural network by minimizing 
the error between predicted and actual


1.updating weight and bias to minimize the error

the process is repeated multilple times to optimize the model performance.

x is the input to the neuron.
The function returns x if x is greater than 0.
If x is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0.


in hidden layer most of the time we will use the relu activation function and 

output layer sigmoid
