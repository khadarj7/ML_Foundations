we are trying to build a sort of linear relation between your input and output data

y=mx+c

y=target/output/ dependent
x= input
m=slope / weight / derivative of dy / dx
c=constant/ intercept/ bias

if there is no c

so what will happen

m=0
x=1
y=mx
=0
we have to avoid 0

so that's why we have to use bias

bias helps the model to have a non zero output when all inputs are zero

i am taking here bias value =1 m=0

y=0+1
=1

when your m and c is not zero 

why m and c is important ?

we have to find out the optimal value of m and c

in that way we can reduce our error

Error=?

actual value->are the true , observed value in ur dataset

u have 100 data in this 100 data 70 % percent people are diabatic

100  70 true and model actually predicted the true

100 

predicted-> are value generated by model based on input feature

70%

100-70=30



Actual accuracy=>100

predicted =>70


error => 100-70
= actual -predicted
=30

Optimizer-> will generate optimal value of m and c.

wnew=wold- alpha*derivate of wold

alpha->learning rate 


what is gd-> GD is an iterative algorithm used to minimize the loss function in a model 
.it works by adjusting the model parameter (m and c) in that direction 
of negative gredient gredient of loss function.

to reduce Error 

why we will reduce error 


to increse the model performance.


why optimal value of  m and c is required?

in that way we can reduce our error.


Optimizer -> will generate optimal value of m and c

GD optimizer


main aim to reach a global minima 


we will get a optimal value of m and c




 
Assumption of linear Regression -> 

Linear Relationship between input and output

No multicolinearity.

normality of error or error should be normally distributed

No outlier.

Homoscedasticity



Error function

-> MSE

--> MAE


--> RMSE

1/n summation of i=1 to n (y act-ypred)^2








I am trying to publish one research paper regarding Facial expression and music

In this project two data scientist is working their contribution will be almost same .


who have good knowledge about the music


i want check among who Data Scientist who contribute better


we can drop any data scientist 

we can take musician 


now we can easily tell the contribution of Data Scientist and musician guy

u have house data and there you have one column like 
Size of bed room , size of dining , u have another column so there u have size of bed room+ size of dining
